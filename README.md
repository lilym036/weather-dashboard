## Installation

## Usage
Open index.html file in the browser. Input a city name in the "Search for a city" input section and click "search" when choosing a city. The user will then be presented with current and future conditions for that city.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
